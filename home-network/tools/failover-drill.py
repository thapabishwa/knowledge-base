"""Time a failover drill from the user's side of the network.

You do the physical part -- pull a CPE, sit on a call. This does the timing:

  * probes the internet every 0.2 s with a fresh TCP connection to 1.1.1.1:443,
    so the gap it reports is what a new connection from this machine saw;
  * asks the same question from the ROUTER once a second, so the gap is split
    into "the router had no path" and "the router had a path and this machine
    still did not". The 2026-09-28 drill needed that split: the controller
    finished at +14.4 s and traffic did not return until +31.4 s, and nothing
    in the failover logic explains the 17 s in between;
  * reports the first success separately from the settled one. The headline gap
    requires SETTLE seconds of unbroken reachability, so a flickering recovery
    reads as a longer outage -- true to experience, but it hides the moment the
    path first came back;
  * polls the hEX's log over REST for the controller's decision lines, so the
    moment ISP-control acted is recorded next to the moment traffic stopped;
  * prints a row for the results table in docs/13-runbooks.md.

Run it on a device whose tier prefers the link you pull -- the work laptop for
ISP0. Pull ISP1 while running it from the work laptop and, correctly, nothing
happens.

    python3 tools/failover-drill.py ISP0
    python3 tools/failover-drill.py ISP0,ISP1       # double failure
    python3 tools/failover-drill.py ISP0 --return   # also time the tier coming back

Terraform uses. Standard library only.
