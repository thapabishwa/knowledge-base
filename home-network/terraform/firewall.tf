# Firewall, NAT and packet marking.
#
# Rule ORDER is load-bearing: RouterOS evaluates each chain top-down and the
# first match wins. Terraform creates resources in parallel unless something
# forces a sequence, so the filter rules below are chained with depends_on to
# pin their creation order. That is the only reason they are written out one by
# one instead of as a for_each -- a list would apply in arbitrary order and
# could land "drop everything else from WAN" above "accept all from LAN".
#
# NAT and mangle need no such chain: every rule matches a distinct interface,
# so no two can both match the same packet.

# fasttrack sits first on purpose: it short-circuits established flows past the
# rest of the forward chain AND past mangle entirely, for roughly 3x less CPU.
#
# connection_mark = no-mark is what makes torrent.tf possible. Without it a
# PCC-balanced connection takes its routing mark on the first packet and loses
# it on every one after. Excluding marked connections keeps the CPU saving for
# the other 99% of traffic while letting the split work for the one host that
# needs it.
