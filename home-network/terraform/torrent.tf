  # the torrent host to 10.0.0.1 matched 0.0.0.0/0 and left via a WAN
  # interface, never reaching the router's input chain.
  #
  # Internet traffic was fine, since a default route is the right answer for it.
  # Everything LOCAL broke, including DNS -- so the client had a valid listen
  # socket, DHT enabled, and no way to resolve a tracker. It looked like a dead
  # torrent.

  # value, and a torrent host talking to a CPE is not a real case.
