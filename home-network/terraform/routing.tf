# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Routing rules. ORDER IS EVERYTHING HERE.
#
# Rules match top-down, first match wins, and the last rule is src 10.0.0.0/24
# -- the whole LAN. Anything placed below it is dead config. The groups are
# therefore chained with depends_on so Terraform creates them in sequence:
#
#   probes -> infra -> work -> guest -> household
#
# Within a group order does not matter, because the members of each group are
# mutually exclusive (distinct /32 destinations, or distinct sources), so
# for_each's parallel creation is safe there and only there.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Probe pins. These MUST come first: the infra group below matches
# src 10.0.0.1/32 -- the router itself -- which is where probe traffic
# originates. Pinned the other way round, all nine probes would follow main and
# report on whichever link was primary.
#
# lookup-only-in-table, not lookup: no fallthrough. A probe that cannot reach
# its target over its own ISP must fail, not quietly succeed over another.
#
# HARD CONSTRAINT: pins are /32 destination rules, so one address serves exactly
# one ISP. Two rules for the same destination would conflict and both probes
# would measure the same link. Google has only two public addresses, which is
# why ISP2 takes a different operator.
#
# Two transit-crossing targets per link plus one domestic, deliberately. An
# earlier set was mostly domestic (Cloudflare and Quad9 both terminate at
# Kathmandu peering), so the failure that actually matters -- domestic peering
# up, international transit down -- read as 2/3 up and barely moved reputation,
# while everything the household uses is abroad and unreachable. The surviving
# domestic probe is what distinguishes "link dead" from "transit dead".
#
# Targets are measured before adoption, not assumed: Neustar (156.154.70.1) and
# Level3 (4.2.2.2) both have 443 CLOSED and would have been permanent false
# alarms. Candidates must be measured over the link they will be pinned to --
# Comodo read 55ms unpinned via ISP0 and 127ms once pinned to ISP2.
#
# Rate limiting ruled out by measurement, not assumption: across ~47,000 tests
# in a day, zero `refused` and zero `reset`. ICMP is a different matter, and is
# why these are tcp-conn -- at 10 packets/sec Quad9 dropped 40% of pings and
# OpenDNS 16% while both answered TCP cleanly on the same link.

# destroy-and-create, because done/failed counters belong to the old target.
# ISP-control tolerates the backwards jump: `:if ($dd <= 0)` skips the sample.
