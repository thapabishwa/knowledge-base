# Detect and record WAN state transitions, and shout about the ones that matter.
#
# Written after 2026-09-23, when two things went unnoticed for hours:
#
#   NTFiber was down for ~4 hours and the first anyone knew was a text message
#   from a DIFFERENT ISP about a DIFFERENT outage.
#
#   The hEX rebooted, the controller re-initialised into shadow mode, and
#   failover was silently disabled for 12.5 hours. The scheduler was running,
#   the log was ticking, every reputation looked healthy. The only tell was one
#   word in a heartbeat line that otherwise reads exactly like a working one.
#
# Both were plainly visible in data nobody was looking at. isp-log.sh samples
# every 5 minutes and is excellent for "what was the loss last Tuesday"; it is
# useless for "tell me now". This is the other half: it holds no history, only
# the previous state, and its whole job is noticing that something changed.
#
# Deliberately separate from isp-log.sh rather than bolted onto it. That script
# keeps counter baselines and must run on a fixed cadence for its deltas to
# mean anything; this one wants to run often and may be restarted or re-armed
# at will. Sharing state between them would corrupt both -- the same lesson as
# wan-json.sh, which already keeps its own baseline for exactly this reason.

# Optional. Defines NOTIFY_URL (a webhook that accepts the message as the POST
# body -- ntfy.sh and friends) and optionally NOTIFY_TITLE. Absent, events are
# still recorded; only the shouting is lost.
