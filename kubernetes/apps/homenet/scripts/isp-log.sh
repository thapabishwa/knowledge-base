# Append a per-ISP health sample to a history file.

# Written during the Worldlink degradation of 2026-09-19 (ONT receive power
# -31 then -32 dBm against a -28 threshold, 4-8% loss, 600 Mbps line carrying
# ~200). The point is to keep the incident rather than watch it go past: the
# ranking logic that will eventually pick the default ISP has to be validated
# against a real fault, and there was no record of one.
#
# Deliberately independent of wan-json.sh. That script keeps its own delta
# state for the dashboard, and two consumers differencing the same counters
# would corrupt each other -- each poll resets the baseline for the other.
# This keeps a separate state file and its own cadence.
#
# Loss is computed over the interval between samples, not since boot. A link
# that was down for hours reads near 100 percent lifetime long after it
# recovers, which is useless for judging current health.
