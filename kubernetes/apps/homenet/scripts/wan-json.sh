# Dual-WAN health as JSON for Homepage, read from the MikroTik hEX.
#
# Replaces the OPNsense version, which scraped opnsense_gateway_* out of
# node_exporter on 10.0.0.1:9100. That address is the hEX now and it runs no
# node_exporter, so the old script silently published up:0 / loss:100 for
# both gateways -- a dashboard confidently reporting a total outage.
#
# RouterOS has a REST API, so there is nothing to scrape: /rest/tool/netwatch
# returns the six health probes (three per ISP, three independent operators
# each) and carries tcp-connect-time, which is a real latency figure for a
# completed TCP handshake -- a better signal than the old ICMP gateway RTT,
# because it proves the ISP's upstream works rather than that its CPE is awake.
#
# Reported per ISP: probes up out of total, and the LOWEST connect time among
# the probes that are up. Lowest, not mean: a slow third-party responder
# should not read as a slow link, and the floor across three operators is the
# closest thing to the path's own latency.
#
# `uptime` comes straight from /rest/system/resource. `active` -- which
# default route in the main table is actually carrying traffic -- is still
# emitted even though the widget no longer shows it: it is the one field that
# distinguishes "both ISPs reachable" from "something is actually routing",
# and reads "none" if no default route is active at all.

# 100 percent lost long after it recovers. Previous totals are kept here and
